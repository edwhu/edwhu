Hi, I'm Edward. Currently, I'm interested in developing methods that interact, explore, and learn from the world. My research investigates deep reinforcement learning, perception, and robotics.

### ðŸ¤–&nbsp; Research Artifacts
Here are the codebases of my research efforts so far.

### Nerd stuff
I like studying codebases that are elegant, performant, or just cool. Some topics that I found interesting lately: [dataloading at scale](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/shuffle_viz/), [Jax renderer](https://github.com/JoeyTeng/jaxrenderer), [JIT'ed Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mctx).
