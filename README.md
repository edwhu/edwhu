Hi, I'm Edward. Currently, I'm interested in developing data-driven methods that interact, explore, and learn from the world. My research investigates deep reinforcement learning, perception, and robotics

### ðŸ¤–&nbsp; Research Artifacts
Here are the codebases of my research projects so far.

### Nerd stuff
I like studying codebases that are elegantly written and do cool things. Some topics that I found interesting lately: [dataloading at scale](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/shuffle_viz/), [Jax renderer](https://github.com/JoeyTeng/jaxrenderer), [Jax Monte-Carlo Tree Search library](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mctx).  
Some of my side projects:

### Something to think about as a ML researcher.
What is [your way](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/twelfth-virtue-the)? I think researchers start out very pure hearted, but can easily end up misled and lost. The incentives of the modern research community, particularly ML, is misaligned with doing good science. The analogy I like to view it as is ML is currently a like a hackathon. Like a hackathon, you are incentivized to put together an MVP that works just enough to pass the appraisal of the judges. You feel obligated to use the shiny new "X" because it will garner public attention. Companies with free t-shirts and kickbacks swarm around you.  Yes, some of these things are unavoidable.

But don't be distracted by the noise, and find out your truth.
